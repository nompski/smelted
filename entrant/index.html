					<h1>May 7th – 2002 </h1> 
					<p>
					In the hushed stillness of this May morning, I found myself entranced by the complexity of an unassuming picket fence that graced the heart of the suburban tableau. The meticulous craftsmanship and nuanced details of this wooden sentinel became an intricate narrative woven into the fabric of my consciousness.

The woodgrain, a mesmerizing choreography of knots and whorls, painted a portrait of time's passage. Running my fingers along the surface, I could feel the natural topography of the wood, a tactile exploration of the fence's journey through the seasons. The grains, the lines each telling a story of days gone by of the weather in which it sat, the faintest trails of small insects, perhaps the humble sugar ant each footsetp gentley edging it closer to it's hill or maybe on a journey in search of food. My eyes gazed a small lining of a sticky substance stretching the length of my index finger and it was no wider than the nail attached to my ring finger. I thought it was most likely the trail which helped a humble snail traverse. The snail was a mighty insect, a stoic being, it did not mind its own slowness perhaps because it lacked the capability to or perhaps the likes of snails remained content with a slow, uneventful life.

The hues of the wood spanned a spectrum that defied simple description. From the honeyed warmth of sunlit amber to the rich, toasty undertones of chestnut, the wood exhibited a chromatic symphony that celebrated the nuanced palette of nature. Each picket, a unique canvas, bore its own interpretation of these hues, creating a collective tapestry that resonated with the subtlety of life's impermanence.

A varnish, delicately applied, cradled the wood in a protective embrace, its transparent gloss revealing the patina of time without sacrificing the fence's intrinsic beauty. This polished veneer did not merely preserve; it elevated the wood's natural allure, turning the fence into a living canvas that danced with the ambient light. It was a testament to the owner's commitment to the artistry of preservation, an acknowledgment of the transient nature of pristine surfaces and the elegance found in aging gracefully.

The color narrative extended to the vestiges of a bygone paint job—a hint of pale blue, a time capsule of aesthetic choices that had once graced the fence. Though weathered and faded, these remnants spoke of the fence's evolution, a visual palimpsest that hinted at the cyclical nature of renewal and reinvention. The current coat, a luminous alabaster, gleamed with a freshness that contrasted against the weathered backdrop, symbolizing the perpetual cycle of rejuvenation that marked the picket fence's aesthetic journey.

Each brushstroke, meticulously applied, followed the natural grain of the wood, becoming an artful expression of the painter's intent. The edges, where paint met wood, bore the hallmark of precision, as if the painter sought to marry the paint to the wood's inherent character rather than impose an arbitrary finish. The paint, like a second skin, enhanced rather than obscured, creating a symbiotic relationship between the material and the medium.

The top rail, a horizontal narrative arc, bore witness to the passage of countless days. Its surface, weathered by the ceaseless embrace of sunlight and the caress of raindrops, retained a rugged charm that mirrored the resilience inherent in the wooden grain. A subtle patina, a testament to the fence's communion with time, added depth to the visual narrative, creating an ever-evolving story etched into the very fiber of the wood.

Pickets, the vertical sentinels of the fence's poetry, displayed a uniformity that bordered on the metaphysical. The spacing, an unsung dance of geometry, allowed for just enough visual intrigue without compromising structural integrity. Each picket, with its pointed finial, stood as a miniature arrow pointing toward the sky, a whimsical touch that added a touch of individuality to the otherwise stoic composition.

The fence posts, sturdy pillars of support, anchored themselves into the earth with a gravitas that belied their utilitarian function. Embedded in the soil, they became conduits between the earthly realm and the ethereal architecture of the fence. Weathered remnants of ancient graffiti, etched by the beaks of mischievous birds, adorned the posts, creating a whimsical counterpoint to the ordered geometry of the fence's design.

The earth below, with its scent of damp soil and burgeoning life, formed the stage upon which the picket fence danced its silent ballet with nature. Blades of grass, each one a verdant testament to the cyclical dance of seasons, whispered beneath my footsteps as I continued my reverie.

As I lingered in the presence of this seemingly ordinary picket fence, the details of its existence unveiled themselves like the pages of an intricate novel. It became more than a mere structure; it transformed into a microcosm of existence, a living testament to the beauty hidden in the details, the resilience ingrained in weathered wood, and the artistry embedded in the mundane.

With the image of the picket fence etched into the canvas of this May morning, I carried on, infused with the sublime awareness of the poetry that surrounded me—a reminder that even in the minutiae of life, there lies a profound beauty waiting to be discovered. And so, the pages of my journal, a chronicle of the extraordinary found in the ordinary, continued to unfold, each word a brushstroke in the ongoing narrative of existence. <br>
