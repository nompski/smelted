BrooklynInstaller,

Hey there your post caught my attention because, like I mentioned before NYC is going through a similar camera invasion. I've seen those futuristic-looking cameras popping up all over the city, not just in the touristy spots.

It's wild that you're on the inside of this, installing them. Have you noticed anything strange or received any peculiar instructions about their use? It would be interesting to see if you could take one apart, maybe you have some duds you can take home? Not really sure how your line of work, well... works.

Stay charged,
