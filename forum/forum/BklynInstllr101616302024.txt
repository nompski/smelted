Hello fellow basement dwellers,

Your curiosity is as great as mine. So, after your suggestions, I decided to push my luck a bit at work. I had a sit-down with my boss about these cameras, and let me tell you, it was weird.

According to him, these cameras are part of a massive "city-wide security upgrade" backed by the city council. But here's where it gets interesting â€“ he clammed up when I asked for specifics. He gave me the whole "need-to-know basis" spiel. Said he's not allowed to disclose what they're for and that's it's not my job to know, just to install them.

I couldn't leave it there. I'm too curious for my own good. So, I've decided to take matters into my own hands. I'm going to try and nag one from the office some time. I should be able to get a look at it before it gets sent out to be mounted.

I'll be getting my hands on one soon, and I'll see what makes these things tick. I'll keep you posted on my findings. Maybe this will shed some light on our shared camera invasion.

Watch this space,
