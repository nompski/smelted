Hey city folks,

Not based in London, but I'm in New York City. I sware every block has doubled in the number of camera It's not just the usual suspects like Times Square; even my quiet corner has eyes now. Weird cameras too they don't look like the generic ones you see idk they seem more advanced, I guess.

Is this some kind of coordinated effort between cities, or are we living in a new episode of Black Mirror? Share your camera sightings and conspiracy theories. I don't know probably just paranoid.

Stay charged,
