Hey Brooklynites,

So, I've been working for this security company, and let me tell you, the past month has been bonkers. We got a contract from the city council to install cameras - like, a lot of them. Close to 500 in Brooklyn alone. Yeah, that's right, 500 in just one month.

These aren't your typical surveillance cameras either. They look like they just stepped out of a sci-fi flick. I've set up cameras in my fair share of neighborhoods, but these are something else. They're equipped with tech I've never seen before. I don't even know what half of these features do.

The weird part? No one's really talking about it. The higher-ups just said it's a "security upgrade," but upgrading to what? Anyone else in Brooklyn notice this camera invasion? I've got a feeling these aren't here to catch shoplifters.

Let's swap stories. Maybe you've seen these installations happening too. I'm curious if anyone has the inside scoop.

Stay vigilant,
