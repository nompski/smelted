BrooklynInstaller,

Greetings from London! Your observations about the surge in surveillance cameras resonate deeply with my own experiences here. It seems our cities share more than just the hustle and bustle.

I've been keeping an eye on these mysterious cameras in London, and like you said, they don't seem like your typical city surveillance gear. The secrecy surrounding their installation is unsettling, to say the least. I wonder if there's a global initiative at play, or if each city has its own peculiar agenda.

Let's keep each other updated on any developments. The more eyes we have on this, the better. If you can try and push more with your higher ups if you can, really curious about all this now.

Stay watchful,
