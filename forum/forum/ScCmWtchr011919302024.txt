Hey fellow urban dwellers,

I hope you're all navigating the concrete jungle with ease. Lately, I've been noticing something that's been bothering me. I'm based in London, and there's been a remarkable surge in security cameras across our streets.

It's not just the usual spots like busy intersections or commercial districts. No, these cameras are popping up in the quieter, more residential areas too. It's like the city is turning into one giant surveillance hub. What's up with that?

Sure, safety is crucial, but this feels excessive. Has anyone else in London noticed this trend? Are we moving towards a society where privacy is a relic of the past?

Let's talk about it and maybe figure out what's going on.
