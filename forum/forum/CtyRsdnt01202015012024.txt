Greetings urban explorers,

I've been wandering the streets of London lately, and I can't help but notice a similar uptick in security cameras like SecCamWatcher said. From the iconic landmarks to the quaint corners, it feels like every move is being watched. Is this the price we pay for living in a modern metropolis?

I'm especially curious if any of you fellow Londoners have found out more about these cameras. Are they city-run initiatives, or is there something more clandestine going on? Let's pool our knowledge and see if we can unravel the mystery.

Stay vigilant,
